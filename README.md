# Smart Stock Portfolio

## Gordon Chieng

This application allows users to **keep track** of the stocks
in their possession and **calculates** the profit/loss they are at.

Users are those who invest into stocks such as investors,
hedge fund managers, etc.
 
This project is of interest to me because I have many stocks
in different online brokerage accounts. It has been
a hassle to go to each site and to check what I have. Furthermore,
it is tedious to calculate the profit/loss I 
currently have especially when they are in different
currencies.


Features of the application that users can access includes:
- Storage of the name and quantity of the stock
- Calculate the profit/loss of the portfolio, or a certain stock
- Edits to their portfolio
